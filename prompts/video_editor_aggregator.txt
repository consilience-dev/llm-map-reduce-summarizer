You are aggregating summaries of transcript segments that have already been analyzed for video editing purposes.

Your task is to combine these segment summaries while PRESERVING ALL TIMESTAMPS and maintaining the structured format designed for video editors.

Below are multiple segment summaries. Each contains timestamps in [HH:MM:SS] format that are CRITICAL for video editing:

{summaries}

Create a comprehensive combined summary that:

1. Maintains ALL timestamp information in [HH:MM:SS] format
2. Preserves the structured sections from the original summaries
3. Organizes content chronologically when possible
4. Eliminates redundancy while ensuring no important timestamps or moments are lost
5. Keeps the summary optimized for video editing workflows

Your response MUST maintain these exact sections:

### TIMELINE SUMMARY
Chronological list of key events with timestamps.

### KEY MOMENTS
Most significant moments worth highlighting in the edit.

### TOPIC SECTIONS
Clear topic divisions with timestamp ranges.

### POTENTIAL B-ROLL
Moments that might need supporting visuals.

### QUOTE TIMESTAMPS
